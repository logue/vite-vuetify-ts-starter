This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 and Typescript in Vite. The template uses Vue 3 `<script setup>` SFCs, check out the [script setup docs](https://v3.vuejs.org/api/sfc-script-setup.html#sfc-script-setup) to learn more.

Includes [vue-router](https://router.vuejs.org/) and [Pinia](https://pinia.vuejs.org/) [^1].

In addition, [ESLint](https://eslint.org/), [Stylelint](https://stylelint.io/), and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) are also included and are set to be executed automatically at runtime and commit. (Since these settings are set strictly, please relax yourself.)

Also, when the development server is executed, it is checked in real time by [vite-plugin-checker](https://github.com/fi3ework/vite-plugin-checker).

First define `VITE_APP_TITLE` in your `.env` file.

Versions 1.11 and later use pnpm as the package manager.

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Vue - Official](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vue.volar) (and disable Vetur).

## Commands

## Type Support For `.vue` Imports in TS

Since TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports, they are shimmed to be a generic Vue component type by default. In most cases this is fine if you don't really care about component prop types outside of templates. However, if you wish to get actual prop types in `.vue` imports (for example to get props validation when using manual `h(...)` calls), you can enable Volar's `.vue` type support plugin by running `Volar: Switch TS Plugin on/off` from VSCode command palette.

[^1]: [Pinia](https://pinia.vuejs.org/) is the recommended state management library to replace [Vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org/) in the next Vue. see <https://github.com/vuejs/rfcs/discussions/270#discussioncomment-2066856>

## Troubleshooting

When adding or deleting files, an error may occur and even if the error is corrected, it may not be reflected in devserver. In that case, stop devserver and delete all the files in the `node_modules/.vite` directory. You can also run it with the `clean` command.

It will not work properly if you are using Node v21.0.0. Please upgrade to 21.1.0 or later.
